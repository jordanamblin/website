        <h1><a href="http://blog.rdjpalmer.com/post/106060299752">Preparing to write&nbsp;CSS</a></h1>
        
        <p>Quite recently I’ve been looking at how best to write <a href="https://nudjed.com" target="_blank">Nudjed’s</a> CSS. I’ve looked at everything. Folder structure, CSS pre-processors, style guides and pattern librarys. You name it, I’ve looked at it (… probably). I thought it would be best to share the love, so here’s a bunch of articles I’ve found helpful during this&nbsp;process.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>A style guide is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization, or field. A style guide establishes and enforces style to improve&nbsp;communication. - <cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></cite></p>
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>So in the context of this article, a style guide is a standard of how to write CSS. A pattern library is a library of components with their relevant mark up, CSS and&nbsp;JavaScript.</p>

        <p><a href="http://ianfeather.co.uk" target="_blank">Ian Feather</a> wrote a bunch of articles on <a href="#" target="_blank">Lonely Planet’s</a> frontend, a couple of which were super helpful during my exploration of CSS&nbsp;architecture.</p>

        <ol><li><a href="http://ianfeather.co.uk/css-at-lonely-planet/" target="_blank">Lonely Planet’s CSS</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://ianfeather.co.uk/a-maintainable-style-guide/" target="_blank">Lonely Planet’s “a maintainable ~~style guide~~ pattern library”</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/styleguide/ui-components/cards" target="_blank">Lonely Planet’s ~~style guide~~ pattern library</a></li>
        </ol><p>Note while Ian writes style guide, his articles talk about something much more akin to a pattern library than a style guide. Regardless, you can still get a great insight from&nbsp;them.</p>
